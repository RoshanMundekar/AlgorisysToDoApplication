# Algorisys Todo Application Mini Project
# Introduction
Welcome to the Algorisys Todo Application Mini Project! This project is a full-stack web application designed to help users manage their tasks efficiently. The application features a user-friendly interface, robust backend, and a reliable database to store user data securely.

# Frontend
The frontend of the application is built using React and Node.js, providing a dynamic and responsive user experience. React is utilized to create interactive UIs, while Node.js serves as the runtime environment for server-side JavaScript execution.

# Backend
The backend is powered by Flask, a lightweight and versatile web framework for Python. Flask handles the application logic, user authentication, and communication with the database.

# Database
The application uses MySQL as its database management system. MySQL ensures that user data is stored in a structured and secure manner, allowing for efficient data retrieval and manipulation.
